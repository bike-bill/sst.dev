## Chapter Specific

### What Does This Guide Cover
#### Notes (From Discourse comments)
- [ ] [Consider using Next.js for the guide](https://discourse.sst.dev/t/what-does-this-guide-cover/83/7?u=christinep2)
- [ ] [Consider switching example to React Native](https://discourse.sst.dev/t/what-does-this-guide-cover/83/8?u=christinep2)

### How to Get Help?
_no specific changes_

### What is Serverless?
#### Changes
 - Removed link to the What is AWS Lambda chapter as it encourages skipping the rest of the current page.

### What is AWS Lambda?
#### Notes
- [ ] [Consider decreasing specificity in Lambda Spec Description](/chapters/what-is-aws-lambda.html#lambda-specs) - As AWS modifies its offerings, the description can be outdated.  By speaking in generalities and linking directly to AWS for specificity the document will be less fragile.

### Why Create Serverless Apps?
#### Notes
- [ ] Consider specifying a timeframe on the cost calculation to account for pricing changes over time. 

### Create an AWS Account
#### Changes
- Tested steps with a new AWS Account.
- Removed reference to specific language since they changed the call to action.  Also removed screenshot as it was outdated.

### Create an IAM User
#### Changes
- Updated chapter instructions & screenshots.
- Updated screenshots at 1280x783.
- Screenshots located in `create-iam-user`
- Left old screenshots in `iam-user` for other languages as I couldn't update them to match the new instructions.

### Configure the AWS CLI
#### Changes
- Tested steps with a clean install on Mac.
#### Notes
- [ ] Consider adding [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) [instructions for Windows](https://discourse.sst.dev/t/configure-the-aws-cli/86/3?u=christinep2.
- [ ] (Consider adding instructions for *NIX flavors.)[https://discourse.sst.dev/t/configure-the-aws-cli/86/5?u=christinep2]
- [ ] Consider adding a link to the AWS instructions instead, in case that is easier.

### What is SST?
#### Changes
- Removed link to other chapters as it encourages skipping the current document
- Added links for the specific IDE Instructions
#### Notes
- [ ] Consider removing the penultimate sentence regarding the alternative guide since it is archived.

### What is Infrastructure as Code?
#### Changes
- Added "using CDK" into the first sentence based on the confusion mentioned in the chapter comments

### What is AWS CDK?
#### Changes
- Changed references to pnpm
- Added question mark to title to match the other titles in the section and the title of the comments page.

### Create an SST app
#### Changes
- updated to pnpm

#### Notes
- [ ] Need to update Next Steps command line output as follows
  - cd notes
  - pnpm add (or npm, or yarn)
  - pnpm exec sst dev

### Create a Hello World API
#### Changes
- updated to pnpm
- Added instructions for Safari et. al. users found in [this discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/983865673656705025/1102040862143303751/1102073623516282890) 

#### Notes
- [ ] Safari instructions for mkcert usage are not working.  Need to investigate further. 

### Initialize a Github Repo
_no specific changes_

### Create a DynamoDB Table in SST
#### Changes
- updated to pnpm
- updated to typescript
- Added clarification as specified in comment

#### Questions
1. Regarding the statement "Thereâ€™s no specific reason why we are creating a separate stack for these resources." Would it be fair to say that the decision to have separate stacks increases application maintainability?  It seems like it could fall under the principle of "separation of concerns".
2. Why is the Hello World API still present in console after this step?

### Create a S3 Bucket in SST
#### Changes
- updated to pnpm
- updated to typescript
- small wording changes
- moved bucket in return to above table instead of below, matching location in the stack file and alphabetically ordered.
- git commit as a one line command to facilitate using the copy option for the code.

### Review Our App Architecture
_no specific changes_

### Add an API to Create a Note
#### Changes
- updated to pnpm
- updated to typescript
- Added info about DRYness and maintainability to the refactor section.

#### Notes
- Should we uninstall the aws-sdk (or @aws-sdk) from functions when we install it into core?
- Should the user re-test after the refactor to ensure it still works?
- Do we need to add [this note](https://discourse.sst.dev/t/add-an-api-to-create-a-note/2451/18?u=christinep2) for Windows users into the guide?
- Referenced [this error handling blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/get-a-catch-block-error-message-with-typescript) for the error code in handler. 
- I'm seeing a delay as I add the API endpoints with seeing them in the console.  I experienced on two different run-throughs, is this expected? If so, can we add a note to that effect at this point so people don't try and debug? 

### Add an API to Get/Put/Patch/Delete a Note

### Unit Tests in Serverless
#### Changes
- Switch to Typescript for testing
- Switch to PNPM

#### Notes
- [ ] I tried switching the domain and the alias so that I could easily remove the domain alias and use it for my "real" app and leave the subdomain for this demo, but it erred with the message. 
    ```
      Error: Validation failed with the following errors:
      [prod-notes-FrontendStack/ReactSite/Redirect/RedirectCertificate] DNS zone www-notes.manuals4life.com is not authoritative for certificate domain name manuals4life.com
    ```
    In orde to keep the statement "You can switch these around so that the root domain redirects to the `www.` version as well.", I believe we'd need additional information dealing with the CAA record or whatever tripped it up.
